  Issues on GitHub are only related to problems of ApiDOM itself. We'll try
  to offer support here for your use case, but we can't offer help with projects
  that use ApiDOM indirectly.

  Likewise, we can't accept bugs in the Swagger/OpenAPI/AsyncAPI specifications
  themselves, or anything that violates the specifications.
