[ChangeLog](#rfc.appendix.B)\n\n*   [Authors\' Addresses](#rfc.authors)\n\n\n\n[1.](#rfc.section.1) Introduction\n\n=================================\n\n\n\nJSON Schema can be used to require that a given JSON document (an instance) satisfies a certain number of criteria. These criteria are asserted by using keywords described in this specification. In addition, a set of keywords is also defined to assist in interactive user interface instance generation.\n\n\n\nThis specification will use the concepts, syntax, and terminology defined by the [JSON Schema core](#json-schema) \\[json-schema\\] specification.\n\n\n\n[2.](#rfc.section.2) Conventions and Terminology\n\n================================================\n\n\n\nThe key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](#RFC2119) \\[RFC2119\\].\n\n\n\nThis specification uses the term "container instance" to refer to both array and object instances. It uses the term "children instances" to refer to array elements or object member values.\n\n\n\nElements in an array value are said to be unique if no two elements of this array are [equal](#json-schema) \\[json-schema\\].\n\n\n\n[3.](#rfc.section.3) Overview\n\n=============================\n\n\n\nJSON Schema validation applies schemas to locations within the instance, and asserts constraints on the structure of the data at each location. An instance location that satisfies all asserted constraints is then annotated with any keywords that contain non-assertion information, such as descriptive metadata and usage hints. If all locations within the instance satisfy all asserted constraints, then the instance is said to be valid against the schema.\n\n\n\nEach schema object is independently evaluated against each instance location to which it applies. This greatly simplifies the implementation requirements for validators by ensuring that they do not need to maintain state across the document-wide validation process.\n\n\n\n[3.1.](#rfc.section.3.1) Applicability\n\n======================================\n\n\n\nValidation begins by applying the root schema to the complete instance document. From there, various keywords are used to determine which additional subschemas are applied to either the current location, or a child location. These keywords also define whether and how subschema assertion results are modified and/or combined. Such keywords do not assert conditions on their own. Rather, they control how assertions are applied and evaluated.\n\n\n\nThe keywords in the [boolean logic](#logic) \\[logic\\] and [conditional](#conditional) \\[conditional\\] sections of this specification apply subschemas to the same location as the parent schema. The former group defines boolean operations on the subschema assertion results, while the latter evaluates one subschema and uses its assertion results to determine which of two other subschemas to apply as well.\n\n\n\nSeveral keywords determine which subschemas are applied to array items, object property values, and object property names. They are: "items", "additionalItems", "contains", "properties", "patternProperties", "additionalProperties", and "propertyNames". The "contains" keyword only requires its subschema to be valid against at least one child instance, while the other keywords require that all subschemas are valid against all child instances to which they apply.\n\n\n\n[3.1.1.](#rfc.section.3.1.1) Keyword Independence\n\n=================================================\n\n\n\nValidation keywords typically operate independently, without affecting each other\'s outcomes.\n\n\n\nFor schema author convenience, there are some exceptions among the keywords that control subschema applicability:\n\n\n\n*   "additionalProperties", whose behavior is defined in terms of "properties" and "patternProperties"; and\n\n*   "additionalItems", whose behavior is defined in terms of "items".\n\n\n\n[3.2.](#rfc.section.3.2) [Assertions](#assertions)\n\n==================================================\n\n\n\nValidation is a process of checking assertions. Each assertion adds constraints that an instance must satisfy in order to successfully validate.\n\n\n\nAssertion keywords that are absent never restrict validation. In some cases, this no-op behavior is identical to a keyword that exists with certain values, and these values are noted where known.\n\n\n\nAll of the keywords in the [general](#general) \\[general\\], [numeric](#numeric) \\[numeric\\], and [string](#string) \\[string\\] sections are assertions, as well as "minItems", "maxItems", "uniqueItems", "minProperties", "maxProperties", and "required". Additionally, "dependencies" is shorthand for a combination of conditional and assertion keywords.\n\n\n\nThe "format", "contentType", and "contentEncoding" keywords can also be implemented as assertions, although that functionality is an optional part of this specification, and the keywords convey additional non-assertion information.\n\n\n\n[3.2.1.](#rfc.section.3.2.1) Assertions and Instance Primitive Types\n\n====================================================================\n\n\n\nMost validation assertions only constrain values within a certain primitive type. When the type of the instance is not of the type targeted by the keyword, the instance is considered to conform to the assertion.\n\n\n\nFor example, the "maxLength" keyword will only restrict certain strings (that are too long) from being valid. If the instance is a number, boolean, null, array, or object, then it is valid against this assertion.\n\n\n\n[3.3.](#rfc.section.3.3) [Annotations](#annotations)\n\n====================================================\n\n\n\nIn addition to assertions, this specification provides a small vocabulary of metadata keywords that can be used to annotate the JSON instance with useful information. The [Section 7](#format) and [Section 8](#content) keywords are also useful as annotations as well as being optional assertions, as they convey additional usage guidance for the instance data.\n\n\n\nA schema that is applicable to a particular location in the instance, against which the instance location is valid, attaches its annotations to that location in the instance. Since many subschemas can be applicable to any single location, annotation keywords need to specify any unusual handling of multiple applicable occurrences of the keyword with different values. The default behavior is simply to collect all values.\n\n\n\nAdditional vocabularies SHOULD make use of this mechanism for applying their own annotations to instances.\n\n\n\n[3.3.1.](#rfc.section.3.3.1) Annotations and Validation Outcomes\n\n================================================================\n\n\n\nAnnotations are collected whenever an instance is valid against a schema object, and all of that schema object\'s parent schemas.\n\n\n\nIn particular, annotations in a subschema contained within a "not", at any depth, including any number of intervening additional "not" subschemas, MUST be ignored. If the instance was valid against the "not" subschema, then by definition it is not valid against the schema that contains the "not", so the "not" subschema\'s annotations are not used.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, annotations within a failing branch of a "oneOf", "anyOf", "then", or "else" MUST be ignored even when the instance successfully validates against the complete schema document.\n\n\n\n[3.3.2.](#rfc.section.3.3.2) Annotations and Short-Circuit Validation\n\n=====================================================================\n\n\n\nAnnotation keywords MUST be applied to all possible sub-instances. Even if such application can be short-circuited when only assertion evaluation is needed. For instance, the "contains" keyword need only be checked for assertions until at least one array item proves valid. However, when working with annotations, all items in the array must be evaluated to determine all items with which the annotations should be associated.\n\n\n\n[4.](#rfc.section.4) Interoperability Considerations\n\n====================================================\n\n\n\n[4.1.](#rfc.section.4.1) Validation of String Instances\n\n=======================================================\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that the nul character (\\\u0000) is valid in a JSON string. An instance to validate may contain a string value with this character, regardless of the ability of the underlying programming language to deal with such data.\n\n\n\n[4.2.](#rfc.section.4.2) Validation of Numeric Instances\n\n========================================================\n\n\n\nThe JSON specification allows numbers with arbitrary precision, and JSON Schema does not add any such bounds. This means that numeric instances processed by JSON Schema can be arbitrarily large and/or have an arbitrarily long decimal part, regardless of the ability of the underlying programming language to deal with such data.\n\n\n\n[4.3.](#rfc.section.4.3) [Regular Expressions](#regexInterop)\n\n=============================================================\n\n\n\nTwo validation keywords, "pattern" and "patternProperties", use regular expressions to express constraints, and the "regex" value for the "format" keyword constrains the instance value to be a regular expression. These regular expressions SHOULD be valid according to the [ECMA 262](#ecma262) \\[ecma262\\] regular expression dialect.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, given the high disparity in regular expression constructs support, schema authors SHOULD limit themselves to the following regular expression tokens:\n\n\n\n*   individual Unicode characters, as defined by the [JSON specification](#RFC7159) \\[RFC7159\\];\n\n*   simple character classes (\\[abc\\]), range character classes (\\[a-z\\]);\n\n*   complemented character classes (\\[^abc\\], \\[^a-z\\]);\n\n*   simple quantifiers: "+" (one or more), "\\*" (zero or more), "?" (zero or one), and their lazy versions ("+?", "\\*?", "??");\n\n*   range quantifiers: "{x}" (exactly x occurrences), "{x,y}" (at least x, at most y, occurrences), {x,} (x occurrences or more), and their lazy versions;\n\n*   the beginning-of-input ("^") and end-of-input ("$") anchors;\n\n*   simple grouping ("(...)") and alternation ("|").\n\n\n\nFinally, implementations MUST NOT take regular expressions to be anchored, neither at the beginning nor at the end. This means, for instance, the pattern "es" matches "expression".\n\n\n\n[5.](#rfc.section.5) Meta-Schema\n\n================================\n\n\n\nThe current URI for the JSON Schema Validation is <[http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#](http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#)\\>.\n\n\n\n[6.](#rfc.section.6) Validation Keywords\n\n========================================\n\n\n\nValidation keywords in a schema impose requirements for successful validation of an instance.\n\n\n\n[6.1.](#rfc.section.6.1) [Validation Keywords for Any Instance Type](#general)\n\n==============================================================================\n\n\n\n[6.1.1.](#rfc.section.6.1.1) type\n\n=================================\n\n\n\nThe value of this keyword MUST be either a string or an array.

This array SHOULD have at least one element. Elements in the array SHOULD be unique.\n\n\n\nAn instance validates successfully against this keyword if its value is equal to one of the elements in this keyword\'s array value.\n\n\n\nElements in the array might be of any value, including null.\n\n\n\n[6.1.3.](#rfc.section.6.1.3) const\n\n==================================\n\n\n\nThe value of this keyword MAY be of any type, including null.\n\n\n\nAn instance validates successfully against this keyword if its value is equal to the value of the keyword.\n\n\n\n[6.2.](#rfc.section.6.2) [Validation Keywords for Numeric Instances (number and integer)](#numeric)\n\n===================================================================================================\n\n\n\n[6.2.1.](#rfc.section.6.2.1) multipleOf\n\n=======================================\n\n\n\nThe value of "multipleOf" MUST be a number, strictly greater than 0.\n\n\n\nA numeric instance is valid only if division by this keyword\'s value results in an integer.\n\n\n\n[6.2.2.](#rfc.section.6.2.2) maximum\n\n====================================\n\n\n\nThe value of "maximum" MUST be a number, representing an inclusive upper limit for a numeric instance.\n\n\n\nIf the instance is a number, then this keyword validates only if the instance is less than or exactly equal to "maximum".\n\n\n\n[6.2.3.](#rfc.section.6.2.3) exclusiveMaximum\n\n=============================================\n\n\n\nThe value of "exclusiveMaximum" MUST be number, representing an exclusive upper limit for a numeric instance.\n\n\n\nIf the instance is a number, then the instance is valid only if it has a value strictly less than (not equal to) "exclusiveMaximum".\n\n\n\n[6.2.4.](#rfc.section.6.2.4) minimum\n\n====================================\n\n\n\nThe value of "minimum" MUST be a number, representing an inclusive lower limit for a numeric instance.\n\n\n\nIf the instance is a number, then this keyword validates only if the instance is greater than or exactly equal to "minimum".\n\n\n\n[6.2.5.](#rfc.section.6.2.5) exclusiveMinimum\n\n=============================================\n\n\n\nThe value of "exclusiveMinimum" MUST be number, representing an exclusive lower limit for a numeric instance.\n\n\n\nIf the instance is a number, then the instance is valid only if it has a value strictly greater than (not equal to) "exclusiveMinimum".\n\n\n\n[6.3.](#rfc.section.6.3) [Validation Keywords for Strings](#string)\n\n===================================================================\n\n\n\n[6.3.1.](#rfc.section.6.3.1) maxLength\n\n======================================\n\n\n\nThe value of this keyword MUST be a non-negative integer.\n\n\n\nA string instance is valid against this keyword if its length is less than, or equal to, the value of this keyword.\n\n\n\nThe length of a string instance is defined as the number of its characters as defined by [RFC 7159](#RFC7159) \\[RFC7159\\].\n\n\n\n[6.3.2.](#rfc.section.6.3.2) minLength\n\n======================================\n\n\n\nThe value of this keyword MUST be a non-negative integer.\n\n\n\nA string instance is valid against this keyword if its length is greater than, or equal to, the value of this keyword.\n\n\n\nThe length of a string instance is defined as the number of its characters as defined by [RFC 7159](#RFC7159) \\[RFC7159\\].\n\n\n\nOmitting this keyword has the same behavior as a value of 0.\n\n\n\n[6.3.3.](#rfc.section.6.3.3) pattern\n\n====================================\n\n\n\nThe value of this keyword MUST be a string.

The dual behavior is confusing and relatively difficult to implement. In the previous draft, we proposed dropping the keyword altogether, or dropping one of its forms, but we received feedback in support of keeping it. See issues #442 and #528 at <https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec/issues> for further discussion. Further feedback is encouraged.\n\n\n\nThis keyword specifies rules that are evaluated if the instance is an object and contains a certain property.\n\n\n\nThis keyword\'s value MUST be an object. Each property specifies a dependency. Each dependency value MUST be an array or a valid JSON Schema.\n\n\n\nIf the dependency value is a subschema, and the dependency key is a property in the instance, the entire instance must validate against the dependency value.\n\n\n\nIf the dependency value is an array, each element in the array, if any, MUST be a string, and MUST be unique. If the dependency key is a property in the instance, each of the items in the dependency value must be a property that exists in the instance.\n\n\n\nOmitting this keyword has the same behavior as an empty object.\n\n\n\n[6.5.8.](#rfc.section.6.5.8) propertyNames\n\n==========================================\n\n\n\nThe value of "propertyNames" MUST be a valid JSON Schema.\n\n\n\nIf the instance is an object, this keyword validates if every property name in the instance validates against the provided schema.

The "format" keyword is defined to allow interoperable semantic validation for a fixed subset of values which are accurately described by authoritative resources, be they RFCs or other external specifications.\n\n\n\nThe value of this keyword is called a format attribute. It MUST be a string. A format attribute can generally only validate a given set of instance types. If the type of the instance to validate is not in this set, validation for this format attribute and instance SHOULD succeed.\n\n\n\n[7.2.](#rfc.section.7.2) Implementation Requirements\n\n====================================================\n\n\n\nThe "format" keyword functions as both an annotation ([Section 3.3](#annotations)) and as an assertion ([Section 3.2](#assertions)). While no special effort is required to implement it as an annotation conveying semantic meaning, implementing validation is non-trivial.\n\n\n\nImplementations MAY support the "format" keyword as a validation assertion. Should they choose to do so:\n\n\n\n*   they SHOULD implement validation for attributes defined below;\n\n*   they SHOULD offer an option to disable validation for this keyword.\n\n\n\nImplementations MAY add custom format attributes.

If "full-date" or "full-time" are implemented, the corresponding short form ("date" or "time" respectively) MUST be implemented, and MUST behave identically. Implementations SHOULD NOT define extension attributes with any name matching an RFC 3339 production unless it validates according to the rules of that production. \\[CREF2\\]There is not currently consensus on the need for supporting all RFC 3339 formats, so this approach of reserving the namespace will encourage experimentation without committing to the entire set.

The rules for determining when and how annotations are associated with an instance are outlined in section [3.3](#annotations).\n\n\n\nThese general-purpose annotation keywords provide commonly used information for documentation and user interface display purposes. They are not intended to form a comprehensive set of features. Rather, additional vocabularies can be defined for more complex annotation-based applications.\n\n\n\n[10.1.](#rfc.section.10.1) "title" and "description"\n\n====================================================\n\n\n\nThe value of both of these keywords MUST be a string.\n\n\n\nBoth of these keywords can be used to decorate a user interface with information about the data produced by this user interface. A title will preferably be short, whereas a description will provide explanation about the purpose of the instance described by this schema.\n\n\n\n[10.2.](#rfc.section.10.2) "default"\n\n====================================\n\n\n\nThere are no restrictions placed on the value of this keyword. When multiple occurrences of this keyword are applicable to a single sub-instance, implementations SHOULD remove duplicates.\n\n\n\nThis keyword can be used to supply a default JSON value associated with a particular schema. It is RECOMMENDED that a default value be valid against the associated schema.\n\n\n\n[10.3.](#rfc.section.10.3) "readOnly" and "writeOnly"\n\n=====================================================\n\n\n\nThe value of these keywords MUST be a boolean. When multiple occurrences of these keywords are applicable to a single sub-instance, the resulting value MUST be true if any occurrence specifies a true value, and MUST be false otherwise.\n\n\n\nIf "readOnly" has a value of boolean true, it indicates that the value of the instance is managed exclusively by the owning authority, and attempts by an application to modify the value of this property are expected to be ignored or rejected by that owning authority.\n\n\n\nAn instance document that is marked as "readOnly for the entire document MAY be ignored if sent to the owning authority, or MAY result in an error, at the authority\'s discretion.\n\n\n\nIf "writeOnly" has a value of boolean true, it indicates that the value is never present when the instance is retrieved from the owning authority. It can be present when sent to the owning authority to update or create the document (or the resource it represents), but it will not be included in any updated or newly created version of the instance.\n\n\n\nAn instance document that is marked as "writeOnly" for the entire document MAY be returned as a blank document of some sort, or MAY produce an error upon retrieval, or have the retrieval request ignored, at the authority\'s discretion.\n\n\n\nFor example, "readOnly" would be used to mark a database-generated serial number as read-only, while "writeOnly" would be used to mark a password input field.\n\n\n\nThese keywords can be used to assist in user interface instance generation. In particular, an application MAY choose to use a widget that hides input values as they are typed for write-only fields.\n\n\n\nOmitting these keywords has the same behavior as values of false.\n\n\n\n[10.4.](#rfc.section.10.4) "examples"\n\n=====================================\n\n\n\nThe value of this keyword MUST be an array. There are no restrictions placed on the values within the array. When multiple occurrences of this keyword are applicable to a single sub-instance, implementations MUST provide a flat array of all values rather than an array of arrays.\n\n\n\nThis keyword can be used to provide sample JSON values associated with a particular schema, for the purpose of illustrating usage. It is RECOMMENDED that these values be valid against the associated schema.\n\n\n\nImplementations MAY use the value(s) of "default", if present, as an additional example. If "examples" is absent, "default" MAY still be used in this manner.\n\n\n\n[11.](#rfc.section.11) Security Considerations\n\n==============================================\n\n\n\nJSON Schema validation defines a vocabulary for JSON Schema core and concerns all the security considerations listed there.\n\n\n\nJSON Schema validation allows the use of Regular Expressions, which have numerous different (often incompatible) implementations. Some implementations allow the embedding of arbitrary code, which is outside the scope of JSON Schema and MUST NOT be permitted. Regular expressions can often also be crafted to be extremely expensive to compute (with so-called "catastrophic backtracking"), resulting in a denial-of-service attack.\n\n\n\nImplementations that support validating or otherwise evaluating instance string data based on "contentEncoding" and/or "contentMediaType" are at risk of evaluating data in an unsafe way based on misleading information. Applications can mitigate this risk by only performing such processing when a relationship between the schema and instance is established (e.g., they share the same authority).\n\n\n\nProcessing a media type or encoding is subject to the security considerations of that media type or encoding. For example, the security considerations of [RFC 4329 Scripting Media Types](#RFC4329) \\[RFC4329\\] apply when processing JavaScript or ECMAScript encoded within a JSON string.\n\n\n\n[12.](#rfc.references) References\n\n=================================\n\n\n\n[12.1.](#rfc.references.1) Normative References\n\n===============================================\n\n\n\n, "\n\n\n\n**\\[RFC2119\\]**\n\n\n\nBradner, S., "[Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)", BCP 14, RFC 2119, DOI 10.17487/RFC2119, March 1997.\n\n\n\n**\\[RFC1034\\]**\n\n\n\nMockapetris, P., "[Domain names - concepts and facilities](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034)", STD 13, RFC 1034, DOI 10.17487/RFC1034, November 1987.\n\n\n\n**\\[RFC2045\\]**\n\n\n\nFreed, N. and N.
