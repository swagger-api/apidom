Use this field to cover undeclared responses. A [Reference Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#referenceObject) can link to a response that the [OpenAPI Object\'s components/responses](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#componentsResponses) section defines.\n\n##### Patterned Fields\nField Pattern | Type | Description\n---|:---:|---\n[HTTP Status Code](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#httpCodes) | [Response Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#responseObject) \\| [Reference Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#referenceObject) | Any [HTTP status code](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#httpCodes) can be used as the property name, but only one property per code, to describe the expected response for that HTTP status code.  A [Reference Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#referenceObject) can link to a response that is defined in the [OpenAPI Object\'s components/responses](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#componentsResponses) section. This field MUST be enclosed in quotation marks (for example, "200") for compatibility between JSON and YAML. To define a range of response codes, this field MAY contain the uppercase wildcard character `X`. For example, `2XX` represents all response codes between `[200-299]`. Only the following range definitions are allowed: `1XX`, `2XX`, `3XX`, `4XX`, and `5XX`. If a response is defined using an explicit code, the explicit code definition takes precedence over the range definition for that code.\n\n\nThis object MAY be extended with [Specification Extensions](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#specificationExtensions).\n\n##### Responses Object Example\n\nA 200 response for a successful operation and a default response for others (implying an error):\n\n\n\\\nJSON\n```json\n{\n  "200": {\n    "description": "a pet to be returned",\n    "content": {\n      "application/json": {\n        "schema": {\n          "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Pet"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  "default": {\n    "description": "Unexpected error",\n    "content": {\n      "application/json": {\n        "schema": {\n          "$ref": "#/components/schemas/ErrorModel"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n\\\nYAML\n```yaml\n\'200\':\n  description: a pet to be returned\n  content:\n    application/json:\n      schema:\n        $ref: \'#/components/schemas/Pet\'\ndefault:\n  description: Unexpected error\n  content:\n    application/json:\n      schema:\n        $ref: \'#/components/schemas/ErrorModel\'\n```',
