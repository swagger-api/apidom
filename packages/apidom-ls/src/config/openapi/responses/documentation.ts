The container maps a HTTP response code to the expected response. It is not expected from the documentation to necessarily cover all possible HTTP response codes, since they may not be known in advance. However, it is expected from the documentation to cover a successful operation response and any known errors.\n\nThe `default` can be used as the default response object for all HTTP codes that are not covered individually by the specification.\n\nThe `Responses Object` MUST contain at least one response code, and it SHOULD be the response for a successful operation call.\n\n##### Fixed Fields\nField Name | Type | Description\n---|:---:|---\ndefault | [Response Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#responseObject) \\| [Reference Object](#referenceObject) | The documentation of responses other than the ones declared for specific HTTP response codes.

[Reference Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#referenceObject) can be used to link to a response that is defined at the [Swagger Object\'s responses](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#swaggerResponses) section.\n\n##### Patterned Fields\nField Pattern | Type | Description\n---|:---:|---\n{[HTTP Status Code](#httpCodes)} | [Response Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#responseObject) \\| [Reference Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#referenceObject) | Any [HTTP status code](#httpCodes) can be used as the property name (one property per HTTP status code).
